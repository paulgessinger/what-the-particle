# Integration Test Fix - SPA Frontend Serving

## Problem
The integration tests were failing after implementing frontend serving because the backend's catch-all route was intercepting API requests and serving HTML instead of proper API error responses.

### Error Messages
```
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
# Tests trying to parse JSON but getting HTML

assert 200 in [400, 404, 422, 500]
# Tests expecting API errors but getting 200 (frontend served)
```

## Root Cause
The FastAPI backend has a catch-all route `@app.get("/{path:path}")` that serves the frontend for SPA routing. However, this was catching ALL unmatched requests, including:

1. **Malformed API requests** that should return proper error codes
2. **Edge case search requests** where empty strings created invalid URLs

## Solution Applied

### 1. API Route Filtering in Catch-All
**Before (❌ Problematic)**:
```python
@app.get("/{path:path}")
async def serve_frontend(path: str) -> Any:
    # Served frontend for ALL unmatched routes
    if static_dir:
        return FileResponse(static_dir / "index.html")
```

**After (✅ Fixed)**:
```python
@app.get("/{path:path}")
async def serve_frontend(path: str) -> Any:
    # Don't serve frontend for API routes - let FastAPI return proper 404s
    api_prefixes = ["particle", "search", "popular", "docs", "openapi.json", "redoc"]
    if any(path.startswith(prefix) for prefix in api_prefixes):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Not found")

    if static_dir:
        return FileResponse(static_dir / "index.html")
```

### 2. Updated Test Expectations

#### Malformed Requests Test
**Before (❌ Incorrect)**:
```python
malformed_urls = [
    "/particle/", "/particle/abc", "/particle/999999999999999999999",
    "/nonexistent_endpoint"  # ❌ This isn't an API route!
]
# Expected all to return error codes
```

**After (✅ Correct)**:
```python
# Test API routes (should return error codes)
malformed_api_urls = ["/particle/", "/particle/abc", "/particle/999999999999999999999"]
# Test non-API routes (should serve frontend)
non_api_urls = ["/nonexistent_endpoint", "/some/frontend/route"]
```

#### Edge Case Search Test
**Before (❌ Broken URL)**:
```python
edge_cases = ["", "a", "xyz123", "π", "μ"]
for query in edge_cases:
    response = client.get(f"/search/{query}")  # ❌ Empty string creates "/search/"
```

**After (✅ Proper URLs)**:
```python
# Handle empty search separately
response = client.get("/search")  # ✅ Correct empty search endpoint

edge_cases = ["a", "xyz123", "π", "μ"]
for query in edge_cases:
    response = client.get(f"/search/{query}")  # ✅ Valid search URLs
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ 2 failing tests
- ❌ JSON decode errors
- ❌ Incorrect status code expectations

### After Fix
- ✅ **All 10 integration tests passing**
- ✅ **91% test coverage**
- ✅ Proper API error responses
- ✅ Frontend serving for non-API routes

## Behavior Verification

### API Routes (Return Error Codes)
```bash
GET /particle/     → 404 JSON
GET /particle/abc  → 422 JSON (validation error)
GET /search/       → 404 JSON (route doesn't exist)
```

### Non-API Routes (Serve Frontend)
```bash
GET /nonexistent_endpoint → 200 HTML (frontend)
GET /some/app/route       → 200 HTML (frontend)
```

### Valid API Routes (Return Data)
```bash
GET /search/electron      → 200 JSON (search results)
GET /particle/11          → 200 JSON (particle data)
GET /popular              → 200 JSON (popular particles)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Proper API Behavior**: API routes return correct HTTP status codes
2. **SPA Functionality**: Frontend routes serve the app for client-side routing
3. **Test Reliability**: Integration tests accurately reflect expected behavior
4. **Error Handling**: Clear separation between API errors and frontend serving
5. **Coverage**: High test coverage (91%) with comprehensive scenarios

## Commit Details
```
commit ef6dd33
Fix integration tests for SPA frontend serving

- Add API route filtering to catch-all route to prevent serving frontend for API endpoints
- Update test expectations to account for SPA behavior:
  - API routes return proper error codes (404, 422, etc.)
  - Non-API routes serve frontend (200 with HTML) for client-side routing
- Fix edge case search test to handle empty search properly
- All integration tests now pass (10/10) with 91% coverage
```

The integration test suite now correctly validates both API functionality and SPA frontend serving behavior.
